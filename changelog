Added lore

8.21.13
PlayerBack slows when turning. Speed lost directly proportional to degrees turned. Values might be too nerfed now, needs balancing.
PlayerBack rotation code made incredibly smarter. Should have no more direction switches when rotating too fast or wrong way throws.
PlayerTwoTouch's "pilot" tilts to indicate the current amount of curve
PlayerTwoTouch rotation code similarly improved
PlayerTricky and PlayerEnforcer graphical bugfixes
PlayerDash short dash can no longer be activated during the cooldown of a previous shortdash

Fixed Back and TwoTouch "ball kicked out of lock" behaviour.
Added white bars around field so power kick flashes and other gameplay elements aren't drawn outside of the field

All sounds are now ogg files. Sounds folder 1/7th the size.

7.26.13
PlayerTwin keyboard controls

7.25.13
PlayerDash updates:

	Two buttons have been merged into one button
	Angle code smartened

7.24.13
Keyboard controls revamped for Neo, Neutron, Enforcer, Tricky , and TwoTouch

7.23.13
PlayerNeutron graphics and sound effects
PlayerNeutron can now swing the ball into a goal

7.22.13
PlayerNeutron Prototype completed
Ball can have negative velmag targets, will flip the velocity vector when negative velocities are reached
Ball will not have curve if the velmag target is negative

7.18.13
More PlayerNeutron functionality implemented (Experimental)

7.17.13
Kicking Changes in GameplayState:
	Velocity of kick is a base value plus the velocity of the player in the direction of the kick, times the kick strength multiplier
	Hopefully this makes it so direct kicks are faster and glancing kicks are slower.
	TODO: Test with many kick strengths
Some PlayerNeutron functionality implemented (Experimental)
	TODO: Test Gravitational Push with TwoTouch and Back

7.17.13
Minor optimizations:
	Cast delta to float at top of update, reducing number of delta casts in individual methods

7.15.13
PlayerBack graphics and sound effects

7.11.13
Added angle control code changes to PlayerBack, with slight modifications
	TODO: Test between "tangential release" behaviour or "release in direction of vel" behaviour

7.9.13
PlayerBack bugfixes
	Fixed throwing behaviour and power activation bug
Experimental: Enforcer knocks Back and TwoTouch out of lock
Removed canBeKicked() as it's no longer needed
Updated PlayerTwoTouch's ball prediction trail to reflect updated kicking mechanics and some bugfixes:
	Moved velocity update outside of vDelta loop, like it is in Ball
	Enoch forgot to put the FLOORFRICTION code in the predictor like a jerk // :(
Revamped the angle control code for TwoTouch so it always rotates in the direction you're rotating the stick

7.8.13
Added PlayerBack

7.7.13
Removed PlayerGun
Added PlayerTwin power "assist": kicking with one twin sets up the flash kick on the other
	Needs testing with multiple twins on one team, twins on both teams
Changed the way kicking works
	The magnitude of the kick is now the player's velMag multiplied by NORMALKICK or POWERKICK.
	NORMALKICK and POWERKICK are always over 1.0.
	This hopefully reduces double tapping
	Note: If the player is not moving then the magnitude of the kick is reduced
Kickingcooldown returns, but instead of having balls go through players when they're in cooldown, it nudges the ball like player on player collision
Modified slice.png to be thinner

7.4.13
Added PlayerGun, begun implementation

7.3.13
Minor updates to PlayerTricky's drawing of the fake ball and player: ball and player have separate alphas
Changed PlayerEnforcer's rapid turn graphical effect
Smoothed the camera movement when a PlayerTricky's double fades away

7.2.13
Added PlayerTricky functionality
Added PlayerDummy: An invisible, non colliding Player subclass used primarily for moving the camera
Added BallFake: Identical to Ball except it bounces off goals

7.1.13
Update TwoTouch:
	Getting pushed around in lock is much less slippery
	Fixed ball predictor showing a reflection off a goal
	Ball predictor fades with distance, is squares now, goes for longer
Update Dash:
	Minor bugfix. Releasing short dash with left stick unheld doesn't cause the kick flash and sound fx
	The ball bouncing off a wall no longer cancels gust
	When you dash, it now calculates if the ball will enter the trail within a certain time. If so, it will gust with the delay extended by that time
		In effect, it's like the trail can "catch" the ball for a gust, for a short window after the dash.
		The duration of the window needs testing, of course. It's really effective at catching fast balls
	The backkick range is slightly widened so it'll kick if the trail appears to connect with even the edge of the ball 
Update Enforcer
	Less turning in enforcement mode
	Doesn't lose speed if reactivating power after letting go of the button. Lets you turn instantly if you release and repress the button
	Accompanying graphical and sound effects for the above maneuvre
	STEPCOOLDOWN is actually proportional to player speed now

6.29.13
Updated TwoTouch:
	Now locked mode will have a prediction trail that reflects the path of the ball when kicked
Curve magnitude is now based on how much the right stick is pressed
PlayerCharge is now called PlayerDash

6.28.13
Updated kicking mechanic to not be as crazy, reduced magnitude of kick, both velocity factor and kick factor
Updated TwoTouch:
	Slower movement when activating zone
	Added boolean flag lockCooldown to implement kicking the ball away from TwoTouch

Updated Ball:
	Added setPlayers to allow ball keeping track of players
	Updated clearLock to allow for knocking ball away from TwoTouch

6.21.13
Added updateCounters() method to make code marginally neater
Added visual for direction being held on right stick
Modified PlayerCharge to be a delayed kick special
	Short dash activates on release
	While holding down shortdash, can directly modify gust velocity
	Added visual indication of gust velocity

6.19.13
More sounds added, attendant bugfixes
PlayerCharge now has short dash
PlayerCharge now has ghostly afterimage to kick the ball after a dash, can control direction with short dash

6.18.13
Added lots of sounds for new Players, attendant bugfixes

6.17.13
Continued PlayerEnforcer functionality and visuals
Added stunning to Player
Fixed Player.render() methods to stop using getters

6.13.13
Updated PlayerTwoTouch catching the ball to be smoother
Added PlayerEnforcer

6.12.13
Added recoil to PlayerCharge
Added dash chaining to PlayerCharge (Still needs testing)
Fixed Dash Trail being drawn incorrectly (pos was erroneously being cast as int in updatePos())
Adding speedUp() and slowDown() to ball, to allow accelerating the velMag
	Ball now accelerates into PlayerCharge's gust
	Ball now decelerates into PlayerTwoTouch's 'lock' (Scaled by velocity so game modes with faster balls don't push him ridiculously far. Maybe they should)
Locking is now a property of the ball: The ball can be kicked/gusted out of a PlayerTwoTouch's lock

6.11.13
Added graphical effect for PlayerCharge
Fixed power kick flash trail drawing to be fillRect instead of drawLine
Changed PlayerCharge charging behaviour

6.10.13
Added graphical effect for TwoTouch lock/zone
Figured out drawing a different polygon for each player
Made velocity add in kicking only in positive direction
Began PlayerCharge

6.7.13
Revamped TwoTouch
Fixed bug in ball.getPrevX() : forgot to multiply by velMag
Fixed Drawing of PowerKick trails to accommodate the new kicking mechanics
Fixed bug in TwoTouch: He will now choose the direction of shortest rotation when rotating in lock around the ball
Fixed bug in TwoTouch: Will no longer rotate through walls in a lock
Added teamColors array so goals will draw correct colour when Twins are on the field

6.6.13
Changed kicking mechanics to account for movement of player at time of kicking

6.3.13
Made PlayerTwoTouch attract the ball ('PlayerTwoTouch Revert'/ 'PlayerGravitron' mess) Prototype

6.2.13
Changed player collision with wall code so that players can get flush with wall
Slightly smoothed camera scrolling

5.31.13
Made Player abstract, made methods update(), isKicking(), setPower(), flashKick(), activatePower() and powerKeyReleased() abstract.
Gave PlayerTwoTouch more stationary dribble effect in setKicking()
Prep for Twins: Players now contain an array of all players instead of just otherPlayer
				Players have variable slowMo which is set by PlayerNeo when he goes in and out of slowmo
				GameplayState does things by iterating through players array instead of referencing p1 and p2
Added PlayerTwin.
Added Actioncam == 0 functionality

5.30.13:
Added player on player collision sliding in Player.updatePos()
Made PlayerPuffer smaller (300 from 400)
Touching the ball while inflating as Puffer will be a flash kick
	BUG: Possible double tapping, makes ball slower than should be
		MAYBE RESOLVED: Added get and set canBeKicked() methods to Ball, so it can't be kicked by the same player after it's been kicked until it leaves kickrange
						However this might not be a solution. Bug is hard to reproduce sometimes
		NOPE NOT RESOLVED
		ACTUALLY RESOLVED: kickingCoolDown is now a more general purpose flag/variable. PlayerPuffer's is increased when the flash kick goes off.
				However, this cooldown is only paid attention to when puffing up
	BUG: Holding down inflate key allows power kick at max inflation even if not in the inflating state
		RESOLVED:Reaching maximum inflation forces powerKeyReleased()
Prevented double taps by requiring ball to leave kickrange before being able to be kicked by that player again
	BUG: Preventing double taps breaks TwoTouch, who is all about double tapping
		RESOLVED: Added Ball argument to setKick(ball), so player objects can tell the ball if it should respond to their kicks or not. Specifically,
			all players except PlayerTwoTouch prevent double tapping.
